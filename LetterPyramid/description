Write a C++ program that displays a Letter Pyramid from a user-provided std::string.
Prompt the user to enter a std::string and then from that string display a Letter Pyramid as follows:
It's much easier to understand the Letter Pyramid given examples.

If the user enters the string, "12345", then your program should display:
    1                                                                                                                  
   121                                                                                                                 
  12321                                                                                                                
 1234321
